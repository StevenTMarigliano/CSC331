# CSC331 - Operating Systems course I took at West Chester University.

Operating Systems included a general survey of elements of operating systems with in-depth studies of certain features of specific operating systems. Elements of concurrent programming are studied, such as the mutual exclusion problem, semaphores, and monitors. Additionally, the following topics are covered: process scheduling and deadlock avoidance; memory management issues such as paging and segmentation; organization and protection of file systems.
